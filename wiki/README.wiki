#summary How to use simPHP.

= Introduction =

The simPHP download does not come with a file called "readme". This page serves the purpose of the README file.

= Details =

== Installation ==
 # Unzip the simPHP zip file you downloaded from this website.
 # Open the PHP file inside and edit the fields inside the CONFIG section.
 # Upload the file to your web server.

== Usage ==
First off, note that simPHP stats can only be displayed on PHP-enabled webpages (with .php ext).

There are two simply lines of code that you need to display your views:

=== Line 1 ===
This line should be placed as close to the top of the page as possible.

{{{
<? include("path/to/simphp.php"); ?>
}}}

 Replace "path/to/simphp.php" with the relative or absolute path to the simphp.php from the webpage.
 If you don't know the absolute path to the simphp.php file, visit the file directly in your browser, placing "?code" at the end (minus quotes). For example:

 `http://example.com/simphp.php?code`


=== Line 2 ===
The second line of code should be placed where you want the information to be displayed.
__Note:__ Place this line inside your own tags. No tags are displayed with this line.

{{{
<? echo $info; ?>
}}}

 Example:
 `<p class="hits"><? echo $info; ?></p>`
